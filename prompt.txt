How I want this frontend to work ; 

1. It should always make post (not get) request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/bread for responses
2. On reload, set chat to "new"
3. if chat is new, there should be a start button visible on chat, user clicks it and it should generate and store a session id in localstorage. use POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/start for session id; 

4. When Recipe is generated, it should be able to present it in beatifully. 

Do you understand me?
